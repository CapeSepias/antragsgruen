Antragsgr端n v3
==============

Antragsgr端n 3 is the third generation of the Motion-CMS built for the german green party.
It's a complete rewrite of the second generation and has some major advantages:
* It's much more flexible on the structure of motions and wording. Motions event support image uploading now.
* If follows test-driven design, using both unit and acceptance tests
* It's based completely on HTML and gets rid of the obsolete BBCode
* It's based on the more Yii2-framework
* The design of the motion supporter table is much cleaner and does not depend on the user database anymore
* Many more small improvements
